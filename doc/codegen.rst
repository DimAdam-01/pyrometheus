.. automodule:: pyrometheus

Canonical Names
---------------

.. This is a bit of a hack. The (resolved) types that type annotation sees don't
   correspond to the names that Cantera documents. This helps redirect one to the
   other.

.. currentmodule:: cantera.composite

.. class:: Solution

    See :class:`cantera.Solution`.
